# So, you think you can program in TIBASIC
Well, you'd be absolutely right, TI Basic is easier to learn than HTML
The first thing you need to know about is VARIABLES.
Variables are exactly what you think they are, Symbols representing variating or constant numbers,
They are at the core of TIBASIC programming so you better learn how to use them.
Firstly, as this is a calculator. How about we solve things with Math?
Imagine this equation
5S=O
Where O is the output in the calculation
So! Imagine this is a program now.
:ClrHome
:Disp "anything multiplied by 5!"
:I*S=O
:Disp
Where I is the input
S is the stored variable.
and O is the output, which will be displayed
