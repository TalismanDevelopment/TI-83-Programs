# So, you think you can program in TIBASIC
Well, you'd be absolutely right, TI Basic is easier to learn than HTML
The first thing you need to know about is VARIABLES.
Variables are exactly what you think they are, Symbols representing variating or constant numbers,
They are at the core of TIBASIC programming so you better learn how to use them.
Firstly, as this is a calculator. How about we solve things with Math?
Imagine this equation
5S=O
Where O is the output in the calculation
So! Imagine this is a program now.
:ClrHome
:Disp "anything multiplied by 5!"
:pause
:Input "Please type in a number"
:I*S=O
:Disp "Here you go!",O
Where I is the input
S is the stored variable.
and O is the output, which will be displayed
Now, currently. It simply says I times Zero, equals Output. Which will be zero.
But, what happens if we store a number in that variable?
:ClrHome
:5â†’S
Now all of the sudden, S is EQUAL to 5!
So now imagine your input is 2
The calculator is seeing:
2*5=?
Being a calculator it solves it and automatically stores the Output into O
So now it sees.
2*5=10
ANd when asked to Display the output, which is O
It displays 10! 
That was a brief introduction to variables.
