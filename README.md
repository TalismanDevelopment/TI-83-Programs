# TI-83-Programs
# Okay, Listen up.
There's no games in here. I'll probably create another repository for that,
# feel free to distribute these programs as required.
# I mean, what's the internet without software distribution.
(HINT: It's a controlled internet)
anyways.....
Probably gonna be some basic TIBASIC programming in here,
I'll probably make a cheat sheet so you can start making them too,
# Stay Metallic Horse-Child.
