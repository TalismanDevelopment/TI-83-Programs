# TI-83-Programs
# Okay, Listen up.
There's no games in here. I'll probably create another repository for that,
# feel free to distribute these programs as required.
# I mean, what's the internet without software distribution.
(HINT: It's a controlled internet)
anyways.....
Probably gonna be some basic TIBASIC programming in here, Lots of games lol,
But I do not support playing games in class, I do not take responsibility for any trouble you get in to
I'll probably make a cheat sheet so you can start making them too,
# Stay Metallic Horse-Child.
# NOTE: I LEARNED EVERYTHING I KNOW FROM TI83 MANUALS AND TIBASICDEV SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE MINOR EDITS OF TIBASICDEV'S WORK. GO SUPPORT HIM PLEASE!
